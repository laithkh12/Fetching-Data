3. Set up Firebase
Before running the app, make sure to configure your Firebase credentials:
  1. Create a Firebase project if you don't have one already.
  2. Add your Firebase credentials to the project by following Firebase setup instructions.
  3. Place your Firebase configuration in a .env.local file at the root of the project.
  ```bash

  ```
4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
